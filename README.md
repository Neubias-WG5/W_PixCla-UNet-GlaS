# W_PixCla-UNet-GlaS
Pixel classification for GlaS challenge with UNet


UNet implementation largely inspired from [PyTorch-Unet by Milesial](https://github.com/milesial/Pytorch-UNet).

## Integration with NEUBIAS web-based database of bioimage analysis tools 
This workflow is described in [www.biii.eu](www.biii.eu) in [https://biii.eu/pixel-classification-glas-challenge-unet](https://biii.eu/pixel-classification-glas-challenge-unet)
